        <ul>                            <!-- Bydefault it will show in output with dots(.) as bullet points. -->
            <li>Maggie</li>             <!-- Here in the unorder list we can write the contents without any order , means we can change the order later also. -->
            <li>Kurkure</li>            <!-- Here for shortcut we can create these 3 li tags with only "li*3". -->
            <li>Lays</li>               <!-- This whole structure can be create with "ul>li*3". -->
        </ul>
                                        <!-- The significance of these tag is in semantics , that's why it has been called as semantics tag. -->

        <ol>                            <!-- Bydefault it will show in output with numerical value starting with (1) as bullet points. -->
            <li>Boil the water</li>     <!-- Here in the order list we have to follow the contents pattern , means we can not change the order later. -->
            <li>Put the tea powder</li> <!-- Here for shortcut we can create these 3 li tags with only "li*3". -->
            <li>have a cup of Tea</li>  <!-- This whole structure can be create with "ol>li*3". -->
        </ol>
                                        <!-- So we can say this , there is a meaning exist of this order list tag , it helps to increase readability. -->

                                        <!-- For multiple structure of unorder list or order list we can write "(ul>li*3)*4" OR "(ol>li*3)*7". -->
